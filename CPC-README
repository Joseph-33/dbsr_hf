I compiled and ran the program on my 12.04 ubuntu machine using gfortran 4.6.3.

In the "DBSR_HF" directory, I copied the "makefile.unix" to "makefile" and then made the following changes,

FC = gfortran
LIBDIR = <path to my lapack directory>

LAPACK = $(LIBDIR)/liblapack.a
BLAS   = $(LIBDIR)/librefblas.a


I added "replace_iargc.f90" to the end of the "S =" list of programs so it would be included in the compilation.
I commented out the "mv $(N) $(BINDIR)   # your choice" so that the executable would remain in the main directory.

I then ran "make" which produced the executable, dbsr_hf.

To test the program, in the examples directory, I ran,

   ../dbsr_hf Rb mbreit=1

This produced the expected results in the "Rb.log" file.
